# Extensiblity Overview
*Fx Files* is designed in a very extensible way. In this documentation you will learn about the extensiblity points and how can you extend them.

## What is a File Manager
Essentially, a file manager is an application which helps you to:
- Explore the files and folders your media (Local storage, Cloud storage and ...)
  - Different file providers (Local storage, Cloud storage and ...)
  - Seeing thumbnails for any file, so you can understand them more easly while scrolling.
  - Searching for files.
- Work with files and folders
  - Doing actions on files:  View, Copy, Delete and ...
  - Viewing files: images, videos, documents
